# AMR-surveillance
This interactive dashboard visualizes the global distribution of pathogen isolates and SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) clusters submitted to NCBI. Built using Leaflet.js and PapaParse, the map allows users to explore isolate counts and SNP cluster diversity by country. Data has been preprocessed into compact CSV files for faster loading and smoother browser performance. Users can toggle between views using the sidebar and view country-specific counts via popups on the map. The project is hosted via GitHub Pages and designed for real-time exploration of pathogen surveillance data.

I recently read a compelling study on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance by Eili Klein et al. (2024), published in PNAS (https://lnkd.in/gmRfvSMb). One key observation stood out:

While antibiotic consumption has decreased globally, this reduction has been most significant in high-income countries, whereas increases were more pronounced in upper-middle- and lower-middle-income countries.

Inspired by this insight, I built a simple interactive dashboard: https://jithin-s-sunny.github.io/AMR-classification/all.html
